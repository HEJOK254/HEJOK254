# HEJOK254

I'm a hobbyist programmer/student, mostly using C#. A Linux and FOSS enthusiast.\
I love self-hosting, operating systems, programming, physics, music and much more. Though I pretty much never finish any projects for one reason or another, so don't expect too much from me \:P

I am currently into operating systems (mainly GNU/Linux), self-hosting (e.g. rss) and writing discord bots, among other C# programs.

## Projects

Here's a list of some of my projects:

- GameBot \[Private\] - "General Purpose" discord bot made for fun with features I just feel like adding.
