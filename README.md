## A Few Words About Me
1. I have no idea what I'm doing
2. I pretty much never finish any projects (I literally don't think I've ever finished a single personal project)
3. I've been programming for about 4 years now
4. I have never properly learned any programming language
5. I am not good at writing. I know. You're probably very surprised right now (fr fr).

## Currently Working On
I honestly don't think this section will hold up well, as I **VERY FREQUENTLY** switch projects, and as I already said, pretty much **NEVER** finish anything.\
Just keep that in mind.

I'm currently mainly working on the RP2040 MacroPad, called [MacroPad-2040](https://github.com/HEJOK254/MacroPad-2040) (I know, very original).\
It's an RP2040-based MacroPad, with 9 keys, 2 knobs, possibly a screen and just maybe RGB.\
It is undergoing a massive redesign at the moment (as of writing this README). We'll see how it goes.

## Programming Languages
My favourite language is probably C#, but I love the whole c family ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

![HEJOK254's Top Languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=HEJOK254&theme=tokyonight&show_icons=true&hide_border=true&layout=compact)

### Frequently used
- C#
- C
- typescript / javascript
- html (not a programming language frfr)
- php

### Bonus languages :D
List of languages I am able to speak, that are not used for programming/web design/ui design/whatever:
- Polish
- English
- Music?

## My experience
I'm a hobbyist :D\
I also go to high school sooooooo

Been programming for about 4 years, though I've always been interested in programming, and started way earlier with scratch.\
NEVER worked on any big project, or really on any project with more than 1 person working on it ( :( )

## What I do
I'm mostly doing just random stuff, like programming discord bots or other programs.\
I'm also interested in electrical engineering or something I guess? Like designing PCBs even though I'm only a beginner at it.\
Oh and also web design (actually almost forgot to put it in my bad), like uhhh my website https://hejok254.github.io/

### About the website
I started working on the website wayy back, like in 2021-2022ish probably.\
After some time, I gained some experience on web design and I decided, that my website was just awful.\
Sooooo I decided to redesign it.

I lost motivation after like 3 weeks and just forgot about it xd\
You can check it out on the dev branch at https://github.com/HEJOK254/hejok254.github.io\
I miiiight finish it one day. Maybe.

### Game Development
In the past, I used to make games in unity, like ChromaCore (insert link later maybe idk I'm too lazy to do it rn), but I stopped when the whole stupid unity fee system got announced.\
I just don't really have any motivation to work on any games anymore really.

### Current Interests
Right now, I'm mostly working on embedded systems right now, mainly using the RP2040 at the moment.

I never properly learned a programming language, just started doing a unity tutorial at some point, finished it, and then went off to work myself.\
The only proper learning I did was probably practicing HTML and CSS on [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), even though I didn't finish it either.

*(i also like animation. you never saw this part btw)*

## What Music I Like
I'll enjoy like anything **as long as it's not rap** or someone screaming into the microphone.

Classical music is a great one.
